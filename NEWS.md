# testpkg 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Added example of an external issue link that doesn't work as expected. The following line should link to a pkgdown issue but instead links to a non-existent testkpg issue.

* See issue [#2092](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2092)
